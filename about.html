<h3>About SSL and its origins.</h3>
<p>Scammer Sub Lounge was initally founded by a group called SPS (Stop Phone Scammers) as a partnered server on June 20th, 2016. But as Lewis's fan base grew and he gained followers, the server shifted focus onto his scambaiting. After a while, SPS moved on and made a different server. Then it was an official Lewis <i>subscriber lounge</i>. But as time moved on, it again moved focus. Now we still specialise in scambaiting, but we love to talk about computers and have fun! We also have 20 staff members who do a wonderful job at moderating and running SSL, without them the server would be nothing.</p>
<br>
<h4>Now, we are offical Discord partners and our server houses <i>Over 9000</i> members!.</h4>
